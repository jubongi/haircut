				<h5>Contract of Giving
				<br> -Under no circumstances may an individual involved with an event keep any portion of the proceeds as compensation for their services.
				<br> -&quotFundraiser&quot means the individual or organization holding the fundraiser/event on behalf of MSKCC. Thus MSKCC is not able to take a coordination role in the event planning activities and its officers cannot assist in soliciting prizes, auction items, organizing publicity, or providing goods or services to assist the Fundraiser in the running the fundraiser/event.
				<br> -It is the expectation of Memorial Sloan-Kettering that the cost of fundraising for your event will not exceed more than 20% of the total funds raised
				<br> -Under no circumstances may an event associate itself with a tobacco-related company or product or any other vendor that would not be an appropriate representation of MSKCC.
				<br> -MSK reserves the right to gratefully acknowledge, but return donations if the means of obtaining the contribution is unlawful (e.g. donations will not be accepted by donors who host gambling events).
				<br> -The use by the Fundraiser of MSKCC donor databases for mailing purposes is not permitted.
				<br> -The underwriting of any portion of the Fundraiser’s expenses to MSKCC is not permitted.
				<br> -Post-event recaps need to be submitted to MSKCC for evaluation and future consideration..
				<br> -Event participants wishing to pursue corporate matching gifts from their employers must donate directly to MSKCC, not through a third party website. It is the responsibility of the event organizer to make the event participants aware of this policy.
				<br> -It is the policy of MSKCC to acknowledge all contributions, regardless of size, in writing to the contributor. The Fundraiser is responsible for providing names and addresses of donors. Contributors of items for silent auctions or door prizes will receive an in-kind acknowledgment with a full description of the contributed item.
